# Commerical Paper Trading Scenario

## Introduction
This is a Commerical Paper scenario, built using Hyperleger Fabric & Hyperledger Composer. It is a full stack application repository
showing how a DLT can be used within a business scenario, along with other back and front-end applications. At the core is a Business Network that supports the trading of commerical paper.

The **Scenario** is that of Commerical Paper, here is [Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_paper)

> Commercial paper is a money-market security issued (sold) by large corporations to obtain funds to meet short-term debt obligations (for example, payroll), and is backed only by an issuing bank or company promise to pay the face amount on the maturity date specified on the note. 

### Why is this a good use-case for DLT?

From [Hogan and Lovells](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/blogs/internet-of-things/three-examples-of-blockchain-smart-contracts-internet-of-things-commercial-paper-and-daos)

> As far as financial instruments go, commercial paper is particularly susceptible to the transition to a blockchain environment because holders of commercial paper notes do not benefit from a fiduciary or other party acting on their behalf.  Once issued, it is up to each holder individually to collect and enforce amounts due. Also, because of the short-term nature of the instrument and the high credit quality of many issuers, defaults in this space are rare. Given these factors and the relative simplicity of these instruments, blockchain technology and smart contract concepts may be able to create streamlined 
documentation and efficient execution of transactions in these instruments.


## Process flow

At the core of this scenario is a Business Network that defines the participants and assets within a Commcercial Paper trading situation. For full details of how this is structured please see the [network documentation](https://ampretia.github.io/commercial-paper-starter-kit/)
